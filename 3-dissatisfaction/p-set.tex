\maketitle

Compute the CCP of the following sentence, using our dynamic fragment extended to account for anaphora. You can ignore gender.

\ex
A\(^{1}\) son of some\(^{2}\) famous actress came and he\(_{1}\) told us about her\(_{2}\).
\xe

In dynamic semantics, we can define a universal quantifier as follows (where \(p\) and \(q\) are CCPs):

\ex
\(\ml{every}^{n} p q ≔ λ c: i ∉ \ml{dom} c . \Set{⟨g,w⟩ ∈ c| \begin{aligned}[c]
    &\set{g'_{n} | ⟨g',w⟩ ∈ p (\ml{a}^{n} c) ∧ g ≤ g'}\\
    &⊆ \set{g''_{n}|⟨g'',w⟩ ∈ q (p (\ml{a}^{n} c)) ∧ g ≤ g''}
  \end{aligned}}\)
\xe

\ex~
\(g ≤ g'\) iff for each \(i ∈ dom g, g_{i} = g'_{i}\)
\xe

Compute the CCPs of the following sentences, step by step:

\ex
Every linguist cried.\\
LF: Every\(^{3}\) [\(t_{3}\) linguist] [\(t_{3}\) cried]
\xe

\ex~
Every\(^{4}\) farmer who owns a\(^{7}\) donkey cares from it\(_{7}\).\\
LF: Every\(^{4}\) [a\(^{7}\) [\(t_{7}\) donkey] [\(t_{4}\) owns \(t_{7}\)]] [\(t_{4}\) cares for \(t_{7}\)].
\xe

What do we now predict that the following sentence should presuppose?

\ex
Every fat man pushed his bike.
\xe

What about the following:

\ex
Every fat man who stopped smoking was healthier.
\xe

\textbf{Bonus: }what is the general schema for going from a static generalised quantifier to a dynamic generalised quantifier?
